# OnPiler
<pre>
OnPiler is a simple server based online compiler. Currently it supports only two languages (C and C++),
but it can be easily be extended to support many more. The time limit of running the source code is also 
taken as standard 5 second one. There is still no multithreading support to support multiple server requests 
at a time simultaneously.I am still currently working on it. There are still many modifications that can be done on it. 
I have listed a few of them below. Feel free to contribute anytime you like.
